        <h2> Individual Reflections</h2>

        <h3>Luke Davis</h3>
        <p>
          I saw the group performing well overall throughout the project. I felt that we each contributed what we could to the collective efforts of the group,
          and personally, I feel that the quantity and quality of the work put in exceeded all expectations. I feel that we allowed people to work to their strengths,
          which we saw reflected in the designation of tasks. Where some of us had more experience in writing HTML and CSS, others were more diligent in writing, or had
          a deep understanding of the technologies involved in the overall project plan.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is not to say that we didn’t have a few challenges. The first challenge appeared to come when we brought on board an extra group member, however we quickly
          discovered that our newest member was a boon, not a burden. A few weeks in, and we began to realise that our 6th group member hadn’t attended any in-person or
          virtual gatherings – this was our second challenge. Thankfully there was already a contingency plan in place, and we got through it.
        </p>

        <h3>Kevin Lam</h3>
        <p>
          In my opinion, our group performed well as a whole. However, we did encounter some drawbacks such as time management and scheduling, as well as the absence of one
          of our team members. Each team member (excluding one) performed well and completed their assigned responsibilities. At the beginning, our group managed to delegate/assign
          tasks to each individual member. Majority were able to complete these tasks in a timely fashion, however due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to take on more responsibilities.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our team ended up working well and collaboratively even though we all had different strengths and weaknesses. This is demonstrated by our activity on Microsoft Teams, whether it be
          discussions in the chat or attending our weekly meetings. Of course, due to uncontrollable circumstances, some, including myself, were not always able to participate in all our scheduled meetings.
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, there is a high level of trust and participation within the group. There is no doubt that there were signs of uncertainty, especially when members would be absent from meetings or not
          participate in discussions. Yet, all in all our group did manage to overcome these hurdles.

        <h3>Rohan Ganger</h3>
        <p>
          From the beginning of the group everyone was able to produce a high quality of work on whatever they were assigned. At the beginning of the assessment, we had issues getting started for example some of or at
          least myself were hesitant on making a start, possibly due to uncertainty or confusion. However, once we were able to schedule more group meetings in the further weeks ahead, we were able to combine our skills to
          get the ball going. The drawbacks at least for me were that it was kind of difficult to articulate the expectations of the outcome. However, when we were shown high quality examples of the past assessments it really
          allowed me to visual the approach I which I conducted my part of the assessment. What I personally found surprising was that even the simple things such as researching, or the design process may seem a lot more complicate
          than it is. One thing I have learned about group work is that you need to trust each other that it all will work out in the end. Overall, the group performed the best ability we could.

        <h3>Jai Wells</h3>
        <p>
          I believe out team worked quite well together, our personalities meshed well and there were no conflicts between group members as far as I knew. Our team also had a clear distinction of duties, which I found rather helpful.
          I also thought we had a good distribution of skills and knowledge. Our team, myself included, needed to work on our time management skills, as well as avoiding procrastination. Paricularly useful was the life experience and
          connections of one of our group members, Luke Davis. He’s already worked in IT and as a result has some contacts in the industry which we could take advantage of for our interview section of our assignment. We had to overcome
          some key challenges, such as a group member I never met, as I joined the group a few weeks after it was originally formed, and as a result I haven’t met one of our group members, Charlie Yang, as well as the procrastination issues.
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, this was one of the more successful group projects I've been involved in.
