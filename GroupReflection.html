        <h2> Individual Reflections</h2>

        <h3>Luke Davis</h3>
        <p>
          I saw the group performing well overall throughout the project. I felt that we each contributed what we could to the collective efforts of the group,
          and personally, I feel that the quantity and quality of the work put in exceeded all expectations. I feel that we allowed people to work to their strengths,
          which we saw reflected in the designation of tasks. Where some of us had more experience in writing HTML and CSS, others were more diligent in writing, or had
          a deep understanding of the technologies involved in the overall project plan.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is not to say that we didn’t have a few challenges. The first challenge appeared to come when we brought on board an extra group member, however we quickly
          discovered that our newest member was a boon, not a burden. A few weeks in, and we began to realise that our 6th group member hadn’t attended any in-person or
          virtual gatherings – this was our second challenge. Thankfully there was already a contingency plan in place, and we got through it.
        </p>

        <h3>Kevin Lam</h3>
        <p>
          In my opinion, our group performed well as a whole. However, we did encounter some drawbacks such as time management and scheduling, as well as the absence of one
          of our team members. Each team member (excluding one) performed well and completed their assigned responsibilities. At the beginning, our group managed to delegate/assign
          tasks to each individual member. Majority were able to complete these tasks in a timely fashion, however due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to take on more responsibilities.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our team ended up working well and collaboratively even though we all had different strengths and weaknesses. This is demonstrated by our activity on Microsoft Teams, whether it be
          discussions in the chat or attending our weekly meetings. Of course, due to uncontrollable circumstances, some, including myself, were not always able to participate in all our scheduled meetings.
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, there is a high level of trust and participation within the group. There is no doubt that there were signs of uncertainty, especially when members would be absent from meetings or not
          participate in discussions. Yet, all in all our group did manage to overcome these hurdles.
        </p>

        <h3>Rohan Ganger</h3>
        <p>
          From the beginning of the group everyone was able to produce a high quality of work on whatever they were assigned. At the beginning of the assessment, we had issues getting started for example some of or at
          least myself were hesitant on making a start, possibly due to uncertainty or confusion. However, once we were able to schedule more group meetings in the further weeks ahead, we were able to combine our skills to
          get the ball going. The drawbacks at least for me were that it was kind of difficult to articulate the expectations of the outcome. However, when we were shown high quality examples of the past assessments it really
          allowed me to visual the approach I which I conducted my part of the assessment. What I personally found surprising was that even the simple things such as researching, or the design process may seem a lot more complicate
          than it is. One thing I have learned about group work is that you need to trust each other that it all will work out in the end. Overall, the group performed the best ability we could.
        </p>

        <h3>Jai Wells</h3>
        <p>
          I believe out team worked quite well together, our personalities meshed well and there were no conflicts between group members as far as I knew. Our team also had a clear distinction of duties, which I found rather helpful.
          I also thought we had a good distribution of skills and knowledge. Our team, myself included, needed to work on our time management skills, as well as avoiding procrastination. Paricularly useful was the life experience and
          connections of one of our group members, Luke Davis. He’s already worked in IT and as a result has some contacts in the industry which we could take advantage of for our interview section of our assignment. We had to overcome
          some key challenges, such as a group member I never met, as I joined the group a few weeks after it was originally formed, and as a result I haven’t met one of our group members, Charlie Yang, as well as the procrastination issues.
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, this was one of the more successful group projects I've been involved in.
        </p>

        <h3>Dylan Dudok-Sabo</h3>
        <p>We were able to have many productive face to face sessions in ourclasses which really helped our team-members express our ideas andconcerns which really helped. Another aspect which I found was veryhelpful was Mr. Clapp. giving us 
           demonstrations in class on what to do and inspiring us on ideas about how we can improve our work. Ultimately, this allowed us to spark that conversation in our group which would really get us thinking and I found was very useful. <br>
           However, what approached us as challenging was the whole group being on the meeting at the same time, as it was difficult to communicate our ideas together and thus, we could not properly communicate as much as I would of liked to.
           This made the process of the work a bit confusing. <br>
           Another difficult factor was that the planning and organizing could have beenmore clear in terms of meeting deadlines. *Start side note* And Rohan’s terribly awesome jokes had kept me going. *End side note* <br>
           Overall, I believe our group has really been able to demonstrate our strengths and weakness, which has prepared us for a better approach at the upcoming assignment and will inevitably improve the quality of our work.

        <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>
          What worked particularly well for us that each member was able to maintain a professional standard consistently throughout the weeks. For example,
          although we had a wide arrange of different personalities, we did not have any drama or disputes, which was apparently a concerning problem for the other
          groups amongst us. Another factor that worked well for us that each team-member was quite dependable when it comes to completing their tasks not only that
          we had some group members, who were able to finish early and take the initiative to help other group members. For example, Rohan had finished early and asked,
          “what else was there to do?”. However, it had surprised him a group member had finished early.
        </p>

        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>
          What could be improved within our group, was really getting a clear indication and nailing down the allocation of the work, as many members were kind of confused
          as to what to do at times. This had caused things to be all over the place. We had also discovered that our team had fallen short on time when it comes to finalizing
          all our parts of the assessment and we had really on the extension that had been granted to us by the great Mr. Clapp. Taking this into consideration our group will be
          able to better organize our work and meeting those deadlines.
        </p>

        <h4>Surprises</h4>
        <p>
          What we had found surprising was after all the weeks had gone past, we had not heard of Charle, however when it came to the final meeting Charle had showed up, which was
          quite the good surprise for the group.  Another thing that we had found surprising was how the small aspects of the work such as researching for the content was quite more
          complicated than it looked, and the design process was quite time-consuming and required a quite large amount of attention to detail.
        </p>

        <h4>Learning about groups</h4>
        <p>
          A thing we have all learned as a group was that each team-member has their own skills that could be utilized in order to produce a high quality of work. Also, another factor
          what our group had learned was that each team-member was able to do there allocated amount of task and not only successfully complete the tasks we were able to help each other
          as one team. Overall, our group had the ability to function as one team that works towards one-goal.
