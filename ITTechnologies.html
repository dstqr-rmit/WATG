        <h2>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
        <h3>What are blockchains and cryptocurrencies?</h3>
        <img src="images/BTC.png" alt="BTC, ETH Photo" width="210" height="150" style="float:left">
        <p>
          In simple terms, cryptocurrencies are a decentralised digital or virtual currency that is based on a large network distributed across
          several computers. The most popular or widely known cryptocurrencies are bitcoin and Ethereum. However, there are more than 5000 different
          types of cryptocurrencies.
          <br>
          Cryptocurrencies run on blockchain, allowing them to be immune to counterfeiting and are heavily protected by strong and complex algorithms.
          Blockchain can be simplified as a publicly open collection of records. Due to crypto’s being decentralised, this allows them to exist outside
          of the control of governments or authorities.
        </p>
        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>
          Like regular fiat currency, cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services. However, it is much more difficult as some are more popular
          than others, with each ranging from different fees or gas prices. Currently, bitcoin has a bad reputation since it is widely known for being used for criminal
          activity, especially on the dark web. This is because transactions are impossible to track, making them ideal for online payments. As aforementioned, there are
          thousands of cryptocurrencies, with all having different use cases, technological advancements, and goals. For instance, as of now, bitcoin is primarily a store of
          value (digital gold) coin, whereas something like Cardano (ADA) is a proof of stake coin, allowing users to delegate their stored ADA to a stake pool to earn
          rewards (passive income).
          <br>
          In the near future, cryptocurrencies such as Cardano may be widely adopted. Cardano’s alliance with Africa aims to transform the entire continent into a single digital
          market. This will allow new industries to bloom and create many opportunities within the African economy.
          <br>
          Another example of what cryptocurrencies can achieve in the future is Vechain. Vechain’s primary goal is to improve supply chain management. Its goal is to streamline
          business processes and information flow for complex supply chains through the use of a distributed ledger. Vechain utilises an internet-of-things token layer to allow
          tracking of assets on the blockchain, alongside this, a smart contract layer to track who owns the asset. Many companies such as BMW, Renault, Yida and many more, have
          partnered with Vechain and as of now, when manufacturing occurs worldwide and not centrally, tracking products is of great importance. Vechain allows for the tracking
          and authentication of assets or products, eliminating counterfeiting or fraud.  Thus far, Vechain is in the works of being implemented in the health and food industry.
          An example would be the Mediterranean Hospital of Cyprus storing the first 100 COVID-19 vaccine records on the Vechain public blockchain.
        </p>
        <h3>What is it likely to impact?</h3>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrencies will slowly be adopted. This is already happening with big companies such as Microsoft, Dell and Tesla, which are now accepting cryptocurrencies as a
          form of payment. The increasing adoption of cryptos could lead to a new line of professions. With the growing technology, there will be a need for more crypto related jobs,
          such as blockchain builders, programmers, or even smart contract developers.
          <br>
          The technology industry will definitely be impacted positively with the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology and crypto’s such as Vechain will offer tech
          companies cheaper and faster ways to transfer funds, execute agreements through smart contract and track assets throughout production. All this can be achieved without the
          need of a middleman such as banks or other financial institutions.
          <br>
          One major impact cryptocurrency have is the reduced risk of fraud. In terms of money, there is always a risk for fraud, whether it be counterfeiting cash, fund transfer or
          even using a credit or debit card on an insecure site. Cryptos rectifies this issue since they are not associated to a government or banks and are transferred electronically
          and securely on the blockchain.
          <br>
          Another impact cryptocurrencies have on the world is that they offer a stable alternative to unstable fiat currencies. Not all countries are subject to outrageous rates of
          inflation but some countries such as North Korea and Indonesia have extremely volatile currencies. If cryptocurrencies were to be accepted worldwide, it will provide a more stable,
          decentralised currency whilst also providing certainty for those living in economically volatile countries.
        </p>
        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>
          The adoption of cryptocurrency is inevitable. As of now, many large banks are collaborating with existing crypto clients or developing their own cryptocurrencies. Alongside that,
          many large corporations such as Tesla are invested and accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. In 2021, Elon Musk announced that Tesla had invested USD$1.5 billion into bitcoin.
          As a result of these large organisations and banks investing in cryptocurrencies, many more people are starting to invest in crypto.
          <br>
          Cryptocurrencies can affect me personally in many ways. In the grand view of things, cryptos can create new job opportunities. There will be a need for blockchain creators, programmers,
          marketing teams, and more. However, investing in cryptocurrencies would also be a beneficial, yet risky method of increasing my wealth.

      <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
      <h3>What are Autonomous Vehicles?</h3>
      <p>
        Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are the recent release of “self-driving” cars leading the future of transport, with almost all major car manufacturers wanting in on the latest cutting-edge technology
        revolutionising the transportation world. Nowadays, modern cars come with autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control, lane assist, auto-brake and even autonomous parallel parking!
      </p>
      <h3>How do they work</h3>
      <p>
        Today autonomous vehicles are fitted with the latest driver’s assistance and mapping technology – from ultrasonic sensors which provide short distance driving data, to, high tech cameras and
        RADARs which determine potential obstacles hundreds of metres ahead.
      </p>
      <h3>The Benefit of Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
      <p>
        The benefits of self-driving autonomous vehicles are:
        <ol>
          <li>Improved road safety – over 90% of road accidents are caused by human distraction/error</li>
          <li>Reduced road/traffic congestion & reduced pollution and emissions – Studies show that autonomous vehicles will reduce transport energy consumption by up to 90%.</li>
          <li>Greater mobility options: For elderly, young and disabled users.</li>
          <li>Greater convenience, efficiency and reliability</li>
          <li>Reduced costs and maintenance requirements</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3>The Technology Behind Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
      <!-- add image here -->
      <p>
        <b>LONG RANGE RADARS</b> - These radars are designed to determine the angle, velocity and range of objects from long distances to the AV. This is done by transmitting radio waves. Nowadays,
        you will find radars in cars to assist with collision prevention – such as that whilst parking or navigating through tight spaces.
        <br>
        <b>LIDAR (LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING)</b> - LIDAR works by having light constantly emitted from a laser. The emitted light then travels to the surface and reflects off objects thus, returning to
        the LIDAR sensor. The sensor then uses the time of travel for the laser to determine and create a 3D image of the surroundings.
        <br>
        <b>CAMERA</b> - A camera, usually found on the back of the rear-view mirror, is used to identify and determine objects in the car’s surroundings. The camera is constantly processing image data which
        helps the car understand if objects are other vehicles, pedestrians, street signs or even traffic lights.
        <br>
        <b>SHORT-/MEDIUM-RANGE RADAR</b> - These radars are designed to determine the angle, velocity and range of objects within a close distance to the AV. This is done by transmitting radio waves.
        Radars are commonly found amongst all cars due to their inexpensiveness.
