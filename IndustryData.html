        The ideal occupation for our group members is very similar. Our choices consist of IT technician,
        Principal Security Consultant, Systems Administrator, Full Stack Web Developer, IT Application Developer and Support
        Technician, all pertain to the information technology field. As of now, majority of our chosen occupations, all rank
        the same in terms of demand. However, others have higher projected job growth. For instance, IT technician, Full stack
        web developer, and software developer are expected to have a job growth of 24.5% and 23.4% respectively, in 5 years.
        Support technician ranks the lowest, with only a 14% job growth in 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, according to the burning glass data conducted between March 24th 2017 to March 23rd 2018, Systems administrator ranks
        8th on the top IT job titles, with full stack web developer and software developer following behind at 17th and 19th.

        All the IT specific skills are all requisites for employees to possess. In terms of how IT specific skills rank according to importance/demand,
        formal qualification such as having a degree and scripting languages would naturally rank first and second respectively.
        <br>
        For jobs such as systems administrator, full stack developer and software developer, the primary IT specific skill required is being proficient in at least two
        scripting languages such as, HTML, JavaScript, or Python. Being adept at SQL is also highly recommended. These are the main skills employers look
        for in employees. For jobs such as IT and support technician, there are no main specific skills that employees need. However, they must have in depth
        knowledge and understanding of computer systems and networking.
        <br>
        In terms of how the general skills rank in importance, communication, problem solving and leadership are at the top. According to the burning glass data,
        communication and problem-solving skills are the top in terms of demand.

        The three highest ranking IT specific skills not included in our skill set is Microsoft windows, SAP and business management. Microsoft windows is most
        definitely a skill required for each of our ideal jobs however it is not mentioned in any listing. This could just suggest that employers prioritise other
        skills or that being proficient with the use of Microsoft windows should be a given. Business management and SAP may only be relevant to system administrator
        and principal security consultant as they may be responsible for budgeting.
        <br>
        The three highest ranking general skills not included in our skill set is writing, research and mentoring. These skills are in no way less valuable than the ones
        we have listed. They are not primary skills needed or predominantly used for in our ideal occupations.
