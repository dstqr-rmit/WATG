Below is our interview with Cameron Bishop, a Systems administrator working in the 'end user compute' space in a large NSW government department. We prepared <thead>
  following questions for him:
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>I’m somewhat familiar with the SOE work you’re doing, but would it be possible to describe a couple of the projects you’ve been involved with? (asked by Luke)</li>
    <li>How much do you interact with the end-user? How insulated are you from the feedback and requests from the general users? (asked by Jai)</li>
    <li>I understand the position facilitates a moderate amount of remote work. Roughly how many hours do you spend per week working from home, and how many are spent in Sydney? (asked by Rohan)</li>
    <li>In terms of challenges you face in your role, could you give us some examples of technical challenges you’ve faced, as well as some organisational or bureaucratic challenges? I believe you mentioned to Luke,
      something about delivering large software packages to remote sites, with terrible WAN links as one technical challenge. (asked by Dylan)</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    We followed these up with further questions where relevant, but as you may notice by the length of the interview and transcript, we felt that most answers were quite thorough.
