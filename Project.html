          <h2>Outline</h2>
          Our project is an application for mobile platforms that will allow the user to track their medication intake and mood over time. This data can then be compared to gain an understanding of how medication can affect mood. This application will leverage libraries such as React – to build the core application and to potentially deploy to the internet as a browser based application – and React Native – to run the application on devices and leverage platform specific features. In broad strokes, the application will allow the user to input when they take their medication – and receive reminders to do so – as well as allow the user to input their mood on a schedule they define (eg. Daily, every other day, certain days, once a week), then to compare the medication and mood data. If the user would like, they may use the app as simply a medication reminder or mood tracking app, though this use case won’t be the focus of the app the user would be able to disable specific features such as mood/medication reminders. The user can input their mood as a number on a scale of user-defined length such as the one found in the app Moodistory (See image 1 bellow) as well as providing a short summary of what may have affected their mood (Had a good day, had a rough day at work, relationship troubles, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          People who take medication, especially mind-altering ones such as anti-depressants (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.) and ADHD medications (Ritalin, Vyvanse, etc.), are often asked how those drugs affect their mood. This can be hard for patients to keep track of how their mood changed between appointments, which once a routine is established can be as far apart as every 6 months. This can be, and is, relieved by using mood tracking apps and services such as the aforementioned Moodistory as well as others like MoodTracker, Moodnotes, and Daylio Journal, but these services provide no way for the patient to easily determine how their medication specifically may be affecting their mood, which can be somewhat difficult to determine if they take their medication on an odd schedule, such as twice a week, every five days or even something like one pill on one day and two the next. An app that tracked both mood and medication intake and allowing the user to compare the two would enable patients to better describe their mood changes to their doctor, allowing them to better treat their patients and provide their patients with more specific, medically informed care.
        </p>

          <h2>Description</h2>
          Our app will initially run on both major mobile platforms, Android and iOS/iPadOS, later adapting those versions to desktop operating systems via React Native for Windows + macOS. We could turn the app into a generic web application using the React base we would have already developed for the mobile version.
          <br /><br />
          Users can enter information regarding what medications they take, the frequency/time of doses (Once daily, twice daily, every other day, etc.) and dosage taken (1 pill, 2 pills, 1 patch, 1.5ml injection, etc.) along with how often they’d like to be asked about their mood. With this information the user can be notified of when they should take their medication and to input their current mood, on mobile this will leverage the mobile platforms robust, refine notification system. Similar notifications are available for desktop operating systems but will require the application to remain open in the background of the user’s computer, potentially leaving a heavy impact on their battery life. The app will need to track the time between doses rather than time on the clock for each dose so as to avoid being affected by changing time zones.
          <br /><br />
          With the data collected, the app will compile it into a visualisation for the user and potentially their doctor to view and to more readably view how medication intake and their mood are correlated. When the user views the visualisation, they will be presented with a graph like the one found bellow in image 2. From this visualisation they could learn that their mood seemed to be positivly affected by the initial dose on 1/1/2021, but after the second dose on 4/1/2021 their mood steadily declined. The user could take this data to their doctor who could possibly use it to adjust their dose or change their medication.
          <br /><br />
          The user will always have control over their data, meaning they will be able to edit their inputs after the fact and will be able to export their data to be backed up to their personal storage solution and to be later imported back into the app, potentially on a new device or reset system. The app may be able to back up their data to Google or Apple’s cloud backup solution, but this would not allow for the user to easily change platforms.
          <br /><br />
          This data may be considered medical information. This means we will need to ensure the data cannot be linked to the user in any way and make sure the user agrees to some sort of consent form. This information was obtained from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and was originally written to advise general practitioners on the storage of patient data, though we believe following these protocols should be acceptable for our usage.

          <h2> Tools and Technologies</h2>
          This app will leverage the web technologies React and React Native. React is a framework build on top of the Javascript programing language designed to enable the fast building of interactive, responsive user interfaces for the web. We will then use React Native to turn this web app into a native mobile app for iOS/iPadOS and Android. If we later wanted to support Windows and macOS we would use the React Native fork “React Native for Windows + macOS” (https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/), though it would be worth considering if desktop platforms are better served by a web application.
<br /><br />
Our group would need to use a programing centric text editor such as Atom, Visual Studio Code or Notepad++ to develop the core JavaScript code of the application. Each group member would be able to use the editor that suited them best. For collaboration our group would take advantage of the robust group-work systems provided by GitHub which allows us to work on the same files at the same time, handling merging our changes into a single file and allowing us to keep track of individual contributions.
<br /><br />
Any computer running Windows, macOS or Linux can build the app for Android using Google's Android Studio software (https://developer.android.com/studio), however, a computer running Apple’s macOS is required to build the iOS/iPadOS version of the app. This can take the form of an official Apple Macbook/iMac/Mac Pro or a generic computer running modified software allowing it to run macOS, otherwise known as a 'Hackintosh' (A portmanteau of ‘Hack’ and ‘Macintosh’) but such computers have a reputation for being unstable and are in violation of Apple’s terms of service, making them unsuitable for a professional project. RMIT makes iMacs available for student use which we could use for our build process.
<br /><br />
To publish on each platform’s official distribution platform (Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store) requires us to have a developer account with each platform. Apple’s Developer Program costs the most to join, at $99 USD per year of membership, while Google’s developer account status only attracts a one-time fee of $25 USD. There are alternative ways for apps to be distributed, however. For Android, we could distribute the .apk file on our website, which users could install manually (Otherwise known as ‘Sideloading’). A similar solution could be used with iOS/iPadOS, but this requires significantly more effort on the part of the user. AltStore (https://www.altstore.io) is a service for Windows and macOS that allows user to sideload .ipa files onto their iPhone or iPad but requires the device to touch base with the server running on the computer to re-enable the app every 7 days. We could upload a .ipa file of the app to our website, but the hassle of using it likely makes it not worth considering. For Windows and macOS we can publish the .exe/.dmg files on our website for users to install.

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          Our team would primarily need to develop skills in web development, specifically JavaScript. We will also need to learn the specifics of working with the React and React Native platforms. Facebook, who created both React and React Native, publishes detailed documentation on the use of their platforms (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html, https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) alongside more simplified tutorials (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html, https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial).
          <br /><br />
          To learn JavaScript there are many online resources such as Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp) and the Mozilla Developer Network (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript). Detailed documentation is available from many sources including the aforementioned Mozilla Developer Network.

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          When finished and made available to the public. Our group hopes our app will be used by people to advocate for better medical outcomes by providing their doctors with more in depth information about their mood and how it relates to their medication intake.
