      We've decided to stick to the recommended software for organising files, meetings, and general communications - Microsoft Teams.
      So far we have conducted all of our meetings through the platform - we have held these at least once per week (once the team was finalised).
      We have also made use of the filesharing and collaboration capabilities in order to work simultaneously. One time this was used with great success
      was during the interview, where we each typed our follow-up questions as the interview took place. It worked seamlessly.<br/>
      This has been added right this second
